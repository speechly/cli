# Speechly CLI

A command line tool to:

- list apps
- deploy configurations for Speechly apps
- download Speechly app configurations

# Installation

There are binary releases for macOS, Linux and Windows, see [releases](https://github.com/speechly/cli/releases).

### Homebrew

If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can install the `speechly` command with:

- `brew tap speechly/tap`
- `brew install speechly` to get the latest release

After tapping, normal brew updates will include any new versions of `speechly`.

### Scoop

[Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) is a package manager for Windows. `speechly` can be installed with scoop with:

- `scoop bucket add speechly https://github.com/speechly/scoop-bucket`
- `scoop install speechly` to install the latest release

You can get updates with `scoop update`.

# Usage

You need an API key to be able to access the API. After creating one in the
[Speechly dashboard](https://www.speechly.com/dashboard/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cli&utm_campaign=text), create a
configuration file for the CLI by adding a configuration context:

    speechly config add --name default --apikey APIKEY [--host api.speechly.com]

The latest context added will be used as the current context. See help for config
command to discover other uses.

After configuration of the Speechly CLI, it is possible to:

- `create` create a new application in the current context (project)
- `delete` delete an existing application
- `deploy` deploy to upload a directory containing SAL configuration file(s), train a model out of them and take the model into use.
- `describe` describe apps to get their status
- `list` list apps in project
- `sample` sample a set of examples from the given SAL configuration
- `validate` validate the given SAL configuration for syntax errors

The versioning of the SAL configuration files should be done properly, ie. keep them in a version control system. Consider the deploy/download functionality to be a tool for the training pipeline instead of collaboration or versioning.

# Develop and debug the tool

### Raw API Access with grpcurl

[gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) is a nice tool to access gRPC APIs.

    grpcurl -d '{}' -H 'authorization: Bearer APIKEY' \
        -v -authority api.speechly.com \
        -protoset config.protoset \
        api.speechly.com:443 speechly.config.v1.ConfigAPI/GetProject

To update the protoset, run:

    protoc --proto_path=protos --descriptor_set_out=config.protoset --include_imports protos/speechly/config/v1/config_api.proto

If there's an error, the user can either correct it by using traditional touch user interface or by voice. |
