# Speechly CLI

A command line tool to:

- list apps
- deploy configurations for Speechly apps
- generate a sample from the configuration to see how the SAL is transformed into text
- see statistics about the usage of Speechly apps

Learn about the [configuration syntax](https://docs.speechly.com/slu-examples/) and other topics in the [Speechly docs](https://docs.speechly.com).

# Installation

There are binary releases for macOS, Linux and Windows, see [releases](https://github.com/speechly/cli/releases). Also a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/speechly/cli) is built and published.

### Homebrew

If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can install the `speechly` command with:

- `brew tap speechly/tap`
- `brew install speechly` to get the latest release

After tapping, normal brew updates will include any new versions of `speechly`.

### Scoop

[Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) is a package manager for Windows. `speechly` can be installed with scoop with:

- `scoop bucket add speechly https://github.com/speechly/scoop-bucket`
- `scoop install speechly` to install the latest release

You can get updates with `scoop update`.

# Usage

You need an API key to be able to access the API. After creating one in the
[Speechly dashboard](https://www.speechly.com/dashboard/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cli&utm_campaign=text), create a
configuration file for the CLI by adding a configuration context:

    speechly config add --name default --apikey APIKEY [--host api.speechly.com]

The latest context added will be used as the current context. See help for config
command to discover other uses.

Another option is to set the API key as an environment variable, where the tool will pick it up and use it automatically. Just set env variable `SPEECHLY_APIKEY` and run!

After configuration of the Speechly CLI, it is possible to:

- `create` create a new application in the current context (project)
- `delete` delete an existing application
- `deploy` deploy to upload a directory containing SAL configuration file(s), train a model out of them and take the model into use.
- `describe` describe apps to get their status
- `list` list apps in project
- `sample` sample a set of examples from the given SAL configuration
- `validate` validate the given SAL configuration for syntax errors
- `stats` see statistics about the apps in current context

The versioning of the SAL configuration files should be done properly, ie. keep them in a version control system. Consider the deploy/download functionality to be a tool for the training pipeline instead of collaboration or versioning.

Read our [tutorial](https://www.speechly.com/blog/configure-voice-ui-command-line/) for more information on using the Command Line Tool

# Usage in Automation

Fully automated usage is easily possible, you need only the API key and the `app_id`. As the cli is also published to the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/speechly/cli), it can be added to all tools supporting docker images as run steps.

Basic example with bash, mounting the current directory as the working directory:

```bash
export SPEECHLY_APIKEY=your_apikey
export APP_ID=your_appid

# validate app:
docker run -it --rm -e SPEECHLY_APIKEY -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) speechly/cli validate -a ${APP_ID} config-dir

# deploy app:
docker run -it --rm -e SPEECHLY_APIKEY -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) speechly/cli deploy -a ${APP_ID} config-dir -w
```

## Github Actions

The configuration validation and deployment tasks can be set up as separate workflows in Github Actions. The following examples expect the `app_id` and API key to be set up as repository secrets. They also expect the configuration file(s) to be located in `configuration-directory` in the root of the repository.

### Configuration validation

```yaml
name: validate Speechly config
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - "configuration-directory/**"
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: docker://speechly/cli:latest
        with:
          args: validate -a ${{ secrets.APPID }} configuration-directory
        env:
          SPEECHLY_APIKEY: ${{ secrets.SPEECHLY_APIKEY }}
```

### Configuration deployment

```yaml
name: deploy Speechly config
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - "configuration-directory/**"
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: docker://speechly/cli:latest
        with:
          args: deploy -a ${{ secrets.APPID }} configuration-directory -w
        env:
          SPEECHLY_APIKEY: ${{ secrets.SPEECHLY_APIKEY }}
```

# Develop and debug the tool

### Compile and run tests

There are github actions for CI/CD, and locally you can run `make test` to run tests and `make lint` to run golangci-lint for the code.

### Speechly API access

See the [Speechly API](https://github.com/speechly/api) for more information about the API and how to access it, as well as documentation.

If there's an error, the user can either correct it by using traditional touch user interface or by voice. |
